My dirt-simple git utilities to make my life easier


githelper 

githelper is a script that can be added to your .bashrc, or .profile or whatever environment shell
you use to deal with the repetitive commands one must issue when using git each day.

gitmkbranch <branch name> : Creates a new branch and pushes it to the repo

gitrmbranch <branch name> : Deletes a branch - be careful with this one

gitmktag <tag name> : Creates a tag

gitrmtag <tag name> : Delete a tag

gitorigin           : Returns the origin of the current repo
